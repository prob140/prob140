Installation
============

If you want to have your own local installation, you should have the following installed:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_, preferably version 3.5
* `Pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ (might come with your Python installation)
* `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_


After everything is installed, you can use `pip` to install Python packages. Using `pip`,
install the `prob140` library::

    pip install prob140


To update to the most recent version, run::

    pip install prob140 --upgrade

You must also have an updated installation of Berkeley's `datascience` library::

    pip install datascience

You should also have the following Python packages, which might have already been installed
by one of the previous installations. Install them with `pip`:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* sympy
* pandas
