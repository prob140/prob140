=====================

This is a brief introduction to the functionality in ``prob140``! For an
interactive guide, see the examples notebook in the GitLab directory.

Getting Started
---------------

Make sure you are on the most recent version of the `prob140` library. See the
installation guide for more directions.

If you are using an `iPython` notebook, use this as your first cell:

.. code-block:: python

    # HIDDEN

    import matplotlib
    from datascience import *
    from prob140 import *
    %matplotlib inline
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')



Creating a Distribution
-----------------------

The `prob140` library adds distribution methods to the default `table` class that you should
already be familiar with. A distribution is defined as a 2-column table in which the first column
represents the domain of the distribution while the second column represents the probabilities
associated with each value in the domain.

You can specify a list or array to the methods `domain` and `probability` to specify those columns
for a distribution

.. ipython:: python

    from prob140 import *

    dist1 = Table().domain(make_array(2, 3, 4)).probability(make_array(0.25, 0.5, 0.25))

    print(dist1)

We can also construct a distribution by explicitly assigning values for the
`domain` but applying a probability function to the values of the domain

.. ipython:: python

    dist2 = Table().domain(np.arange(1, 8, 2)).probability_function(lambda x: 1/4)

    print(dist2)

This can be very useful when we have a distribution with a known probability
density function, such as the binomial distribution

.. ipython:: python

    from scipy.misc import comb
    def pmf(x):
        n = 10
        p = 0.3
        return comb(n,x) * p**x * (1-p)**(n-x)

    binomial = Table().domain(np.arange(11)).probability_function(pmf)
    print(binomial)
